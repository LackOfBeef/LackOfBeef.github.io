                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>I'm a Game Design and Development student at RIT who is especially interested in the design of
                        singleplayer games that are driven by story and exploration. With several different skills, such
                        as game design, programming, and 2D art, I have many different roles that I can potentially fill on
                        a team. I have worked on a few different personal projects already, and have many others that I
                        would like to work on in the future.</p>

                <h3>Canceled Untitled Rabbit Game</h3>
                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>A game developed solo using Unity and C# on and off from August of 2018 to December of 2022.</p>
                <p>The game is a metroidvania-style platformer inspired by games such as Cave Story, Hollow
                    Knight, Metroid: Zero Mission, and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. The gameplay focuses on
                    exploration, with simple platforming and enemy patterns.</p>
                <p>The game uses a melee combat system, with ranged abilities that can be found throughout the
                    world. Exploration is relatively nonlinear, with a few different paths that can be taken through the
                    game. Optional health and magic upgrades can be found as well.</p>
                <p>Through the development of this game I learned how to create larger-scale projects. This game was a learning experience for me in both the programming and design aspects of game development.</p>
                <p>The game makes use of Unity's built in animation tools and uses tilemaps for level designs. Throughout development I made careful plans for how the game's world and progression should be designed, being sure to think about the game as a whole.</p>
                <h4>Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>4 Areas</li>
                    <li>3 bosses</li>
                    <li>7 different abilities</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>All areas are playable and had their basic designs completed.</li>
                    <li>3 bosses are partially implemented.</li>
                    <li>1 boss is fully playable, but lacking in animation.</li>
                    <li>All abilities are implemented and functional.</li>
                    <li>Several graphical elements were created, as well as some music.</li>

                <h3>Covering Weaknesses</h3>
                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>A game developed solo in 48 hours using Unity and C# in July 2020 for GMTK Game Jam 2020.</p>
                <p>The game has pseudo-turn-based gameplay in which the player controls two characters who must
                    defeat a wave of enemies. One character cannot control their actions, while the other cannot control
                    their target. There is a single wave of enemies for them to defeat. The player loses if either character's health
                    drops to 0.</p>
                    <p>This game allowed me to practice working with creative restrictions, as well as learn how to work under a deadline and release a finished product.</p>

                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p>A game developed solo over the course of 2 weeks using Javascript and PIXI JS. </p>
                <p>A top down action adventure game with 5 levels. The game is centered around a dash mechanic which is
                    used to evade enemies.</p>
                <p>In this project I learned how to use Javascript to develop games for the web, and also practiced my
                    game design skills. This was the first fully-featured game I've made for school outside of group projects.</p>
                <p>The game uses AABB collision detection and loads levels from Javascript objects and arrays.</p>
