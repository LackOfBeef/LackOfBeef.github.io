    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>The first thing I wanted to make sure of was that the site would present the most important information first.
        In this case, that was the about section of the page, with the description, photo, and contact information. After that, I wanted to make sure I presented my most important projects that any potential employers may be interested in.
        <br>
        I wanted to make sure that game design and development was focused on first, with visual art as a secondary aspect, since I think it's still an important part of my skillset (even if it won't be what gets me a relevant co-op). Primarily, I'd like to work in games, so I made sure to focus on game-related projects first by showing them off early in the page. This is why my artwork isn't shown in the first section, but is linked to in the header. This is also why it appears at the bottom of the page.
    </p>
    <h2>Sources</h2>
    <p>I made all of the images myself. The main typeface is Segoe UI, but other sans serif typefaces can be used if it is not available.</p>
    <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In the final version, I'd like to have a menu dropdown in the header at smaller screen widths</li>
        <li>Images in the artwork section are displayed at 500px by 500px. They are displayed at 400px by 400px at smaller screen sizes. Of course, this does mean it currently only supports square images, and I'd like to update this later on.</li>
        <li>Project screenshots are displayed at 426px by 240 px.</li>
        <li>Full details for projects are put in their own sections. However, they only get a div of class "singleProject" in the preview given in the gallery session.</li>
    </ul>
