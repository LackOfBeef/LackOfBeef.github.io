                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>I'm a Game Design and Development student at RIT who is especially interested in the design of
                        singleplayer games that are driven by story and exploration. With several different skills, such
                        as game design, programming, and 2D art, I have many different roles that I can potentially fill
                        on
                        a team. I have worked on a few different personal projects already, and have many others that I
                        would like to work on in the future.</p>

                    <p>A game developed solo using Godot since January 2024.</p>
                    <p>A fast paced 2D action platformer, with an emphasis on allowing players to achieve a sense of
                        speed.

                    <p>Players shoot enemies while running through numerous short levels. A ranking system adds

                    <p>Development allowed me to familiarize myself with Godot's tools, as well as learn how to polish
                        various aspects of a game that I had not worked in previously.</p>

                    <h3>Canceled Untitled Metroidvania</h3>
                    <p>A game developed solo using Unity and C# on and off from August of 2018 to December of 2022.</p>
                    <p>The game is a metroidvania-style platformer inspired by games such as Cave Story, Hollow
                        Knight, Metroid: Zero Mission, and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. The gameplay focuses
                        on
                        exploration, with simple platforming and enemy patterns.</p>
                    <p>The game uses a melee combat system, with ranged abilities that can be found throughout the
                        world. Exploration is relatively nonlinear, with a few different paths that can be taken through
                        the
                        game. Optional health and magic upgrades can be found as well.</p>
                    <p>Through the development of this game I learned how to create larger-scale projects. This game was
                        a learning experience for me in both the programming and design aspects of game development.</p>
                    <p>The game makes use of Unity's built in animation tools and uses tilemaps for level designs.
                        Throughout development I made careful plans for how the game's world and progression should be
                        designed, being sure to think about the game as a whole.</p>
                    <p>The project was ultimately canceled due to its long development period creating a significant gap
                        in quality between new and old code. It simply did not seem worth finishing unless it were to be
                        remade from scratcch.</p>
                    <h4>What was done</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4 areas were playable and had their basic layouts completed.</li>
                        <li>3 bosses were partially implemented.</li>
                        <li>1 boss is fully playable, but lacking in animation.</li>
                        <li>7 abilities are implemented and functional.</li>
                        <li>Several graphical elements were created, as well as some music.</li>

                <h3>Cheese Master</h3>
                <p>A game developed solo over the course of 2 weeks using Javascript and PIXI JS. </p>
                <p>A top down action adventure game with 5 levels. The game is centered around a dash mechanic which is
                    used to evade enemies.</p>
                <p>In this project I learned how to use Javascript to develop games for the web, and also practiced my
                    game design skills. This was the first fully-featured game I've made for school outside of group
                    projects.</p>
                <p>The game uses AABB collision detection and loads levels from Javascript objects and arrays.</p>
                <h4>Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>5 levels</li>

                <p>In this project I worked on level designs, fully designing most and revising the designs of the rest.
