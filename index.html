                    <p>I'm a Game Design and Development student at RIT who is especially interested in the design
                        of singleplayer games that are driven by story and exploration. I have experience with art,
                        programming, game design, and (especially) level design, so I could fill a lot of different
                        roles.</p>

                    <p>A game developed solo using Godot since January 2024.</p>
                    <p>A fast paced 2D action platformer, with an emphasis on allowing players to achieve a sense of
                        speed.
                    </p>
                    <p>Players shoot enemies while running through numerous short levels. A ranking system adds
                        replayability.</p>
                    <p>Development allowed me to familiarize myself with Godot's tools, as well as learn how to polish
                        various aspects of a game that I had not worked in previously.</p>
                    <h4>Features</h4>

                        <li>7 levels</li>

                    <h3>Canceled Untitled Metroidvania</h3>
                    <p>A game developed solo using Unity and C# on and off from August of 2018 to December of 2022. It
                        was my first large-scale project.</p>
                    <p>The game is a metroidvania-style platformer inspired by games such as Cave Story, Hollow
                        Knight, Metroid: Zero Mission, and The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.</p>
                    <p>The game includes simple combat with both melee and ranged abilities. Exploration is fairly
                        nonlinear,
                        with a few different paths that can be taken through the
                        game. Optional health and magic upgrades can be found as well.</p>
                    <p>The project was ultimately canceled due to its long development period creating a significant gap
                        in quality between new and old code and design. Much of the old code was not usable at the scale
                        the game reached.</p>

                        <li>3 bosses were partially implemented.</li>
                        <li>1 boss is fully playable, but lacking in animation.</li>
                        <li>7 abilities are implemented and functional.</li>

                    <h3>Funky Mungos</h3>
                    <p>A 3D collectathon platformer made with a team of 7 in Unreal Engine 4 over the course of 15
                        weeks. The game includes one level
                        and a hub area.</p>
                    <p>My primary role in the project was level design. However, I also created low resolution textures
                        to be
                        used for the game's environments. During the early concept phase of the game I helped the team
                        as we conceptualized the general game loop and movement mechanics.</p>
                    <p>While working on this project I used both paper level sketches and in-engine iteration to create
                        a level and hub area for the game. Throughout the process I used UE4's terrain tools, primitive
                        objects, free assets found online, and objects created by other team members. I also worked with
                        gameplay programmers on concepts for additional objects for players to interact with.</p>

                    <p>A game developed solo over the course of 2 weeks using Javascript, PIXI JS, and Howler. </p>
                    <p>A top down action adventure game with 5 levels. The game is centered around a dash mechanic which
                        is
                        used to evade enemies.</p>
                    <p>In this project I learned how to use Javascript to develop games for the web, and also practiced
                        my
                        game design skills. This was the first fully-featured game I've made for school outside of group
                        projects.</p>
                    <p>The game uses AABB collision detection and loads levels from Javascript objects and arrays.</p>
